# Free State Laboratories

Hi, and welcome to my corner of the internet!  

I'm a mechanical engineer with special interests in structural dynamics, robotics, controls, and coding. On this site, you'll find information on my current projects.  

Feel free to contact me at [ryan@freestatelabs.com](mailto:ryan@freestatelabs.com). My code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/freestatelabs).

## Projects
### [`rockets`](/rockets/)
A 2D, 3DOF simulation of landing rockets using thrust-vectoring directed by an optimal controller.

### [`Wired.jl`](https://github.com/freestatelabs/Wired.jl) - *in development* 
 A highly optimized Biot-Savart law integrator for arbitrary geometries in 3D space.

### [`Wired.jl` Benchmarks](/wired-benchmarks/)
Performance benchmarks for [`Wired.jl`](), written in Julia, C, Fortran, and Python.
