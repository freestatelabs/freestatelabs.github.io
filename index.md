# Free State Laboratories

Hi, and welcome to my corner of the internet!  

I'm a mechanical engineer with special interests in structural mechanics, robotics, controls, and high-performance numerical software development. On this site, you'll find information on my current projects.  

Feel free to contact me at [ryan@freestatelabs.com](mailto:ryan@freestatelabs.com). My code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/freestatelabs).

## Current Projects

### [`SHEPHERD`](https://github.com/freestatelabs/SHEPHERD) 
Open-source mechanical FEA that *just works*.

### [`topgun`](https://github.com/freestatelabs/topgun)
Teaching myself high-performance software engineering techniques.

## In Maintenance

### [`Wired.jl`](https://github.com/freestatelabs/Wired.jl)
A highly optimized Biot-Savart law integrator for arbitrary geometries in 3D space.

## Past Projects

### [`rockets`](/rockets/)
A 2D, 3DOF simulation of landing rockets using thrust-vectoring directed by an optimal controller.

### [`Wired.jl` Benchmarks](/wired-benchmarks/)
Algorithm development for [`Wired.jl`](https://github.com/freestatelabs/Wired.jl), written in Julia, C, Fortran, and Python.  
*I've learned a lot since I did this project in early 2024, and it is very much superceded by `Wired.jl`.*
