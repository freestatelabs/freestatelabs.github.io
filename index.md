# Free State Laboratories

Hi, and welcome to my corner of the internet!  

I'm a mechanical engineer with special interests in structural dynamics, robotics, controls, and coding. On this site, you'll find information on my current projects.  

Feel free to contact me at [ryan@freestatelabs.com](mailto:ryan@freestatelabs.com). My code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/freestatelabs).

## Current Projects
### [`Jupiter`](/jupiter/)
A hardware prototype of a "rocket" powered by ducted fans, including a full 6DOF simulation of the hardware. Extends the work of [`rockets`](/rockets/) to the physical world.

## Past Projects
### [`rockets`](/rockets/)
A 2D, 3DOF simulation of landing rockets using thrust-vectoring directed by an optimal controller.
