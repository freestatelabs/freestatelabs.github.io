Hi, and welcome to my corner of the internet!  

I'm a mechanical engineer with special interests in structural dynamics, robotics, controls, and coding. On this site, you'll find information on my current projects.  

Feel free to contact me at [ryan@freestatelabs.com](mailto:ryan@freestatelabs.com). My code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/freestatelabs), and I'm also sometimes active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/free_state_labs).

I'm currently working on a few robotics/controls projects:
